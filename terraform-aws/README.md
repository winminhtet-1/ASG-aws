```
2. To preview the changes in code

```
terraform plan -var-file=../../../vars/dev/vpc.tfvars
```
3. To apply the changes

```
terraform apply -var-file=../../../vars/dev/vpc.tfvars
```
4. To destroy the resources created using the code

```
terraform destroy -var-file=../../../vars/dev/vpc.tfvars


#### RDS Provisioning

cd into the `environments/dev/rds` directory and run the following commands:

1. Init Terraform in the directory `environments/dev/rds`

## EC2 Instance Provisioning

1. Navigate to the `environment/dev` folder:

```bash
cd environment/dev
```

2. Open the `ec2.tfvars` file and modify it with your desired details. This file contains variables used in the Terraform configuration.

### Deployment

1. Initialize Terraform in the working directory:

```bash
terraform init
```

2. Create an execution plan:

```bash
terraform plan -var-file=../../../vars/dev/ec2.tfvars
```

3. Apply the changes to create the EC2 instance:

```bash
terraform apply -var-file=../../../vars/dev/ec2.tfvars
```

4. To destroy the EC2 instance and associated resources:

```bash
terraform destroy -var-file=../../../vars/dev/ec2.tfvars
```

**Note**: Always review the execution plan (`terraform plan`) before applying changes to avoid unintended modifications.

## AWS Organization Tag Policy Creation.

1. Navigate to the `environment/dev` folder:

```bash
cd environment/tag-policy
```

2. Open the `tag-policy.tfvars` file and modify it with your desired details. This file contains variables used in the Terraform configuration.

### Deployment

1. Initialize Terraform in the working directory:

```bash
terraform init
```

2. Create an execution plan:

```bash
terraform plan -var-file=../../../vars/dev/tag-policy.tfvars
```

3. Apply the changes to create the Tag Policy:

```bash
terraform apply -var-file=../../../vars/dev/tag-policy.tfvars
```

4. To destroy the Tag Policy:

```bash
terraform destroy -var-file=../../../vars/dev/tag-policy.tfvars
```

**Note**: Always review the execution plan (`terraform plan`) before applying changes to avoid unintended modifications.
